# Idea Brief

> Version: 0.2
> Input: Raw idea in your head
> Output: Scoped brief ready for AI stress-test

> **THINK · Step 1 · 10 min · You write · No AI · No code**
>
> If you can't explain it without AI, you don't understand it enough to guide AI.
> **When to use:** Once per feature (Macro-THINK). Individual Heartbeats within a feature do NOT need their own idea-brief — the task description in task-breakdown.md is your brief.

## What

[One sentence. What are you building or changing?]

## Why

[Why does this matter? What problem does it solve? Who asked for it?]

## Who Will Use This

[Who are the users of this feature? If no users yet — who will be first? If solo project with no users — write "Internal/solo, no external users yet."]

## Where

[Which services, repos, or components are involved?]

## Constraints

[What limits your options? Tech debt, third-party API limits, infra limitations, compliance, budget. Write "None" if truly unconstrained.]

## Out of Scope

[What will people assume is included but isn't? Be explicit to prevent scope creep. If unsure — write "None — to be challenged during AI stress-test."]

## Success Criteria

[How will you test that this works? Be specific and testable. E.g., "When test fails, configured webhook receives POST within 30 seconds with correct payload." Not "webhooks work."]

## Complexity

- [ ] **Hotfix** — broken in prod, fix now → Mode A
- [ ] **Small** (< 1 day) → Mode A
- [ ] **Medium** (1-5 days) → Mode A or B
- [ ] **Feature** (5+ days) → Mode B
